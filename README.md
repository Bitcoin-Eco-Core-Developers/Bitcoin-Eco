* Bitcoin is environmentally unsustainable
* Bitcoin mining consumes more energy than some countries
* This wasteful energy consumption is completely avoidable
* Left unevolved  Bitcoin mining will eventually destroy the vast potential and promise of Bitcoin
* Every Bitcoin transaction you make helps fuel  one of the most malfeasance energy wasting mechanism of our time.
* Wasting solar energy that could go to power homes, schools and infrastructure is NOT the answer to a simple avoidable problem.
* Bitcoin is unstable and must be transcended Bitcoin has been rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic for some time. 
* A viable environmentallysustainable transfer of value must be established. 

_The next exciting phase of Bitcoin is the shedding of the stigmas that rendered Bitcoin flawed. 
The possibilities are endless for a Bitcoin unencumbered by the guilt of damaging the environment that bitcoin mining is associated. 
A Bitcoin free of shortcomings is the value revolution Bitcoin started. A faster more capable Bitcoin yields the future of all value.
Bitcoin Eco is the solution. Transfer the value of Bitcoin to an environmentally sustainable faster more capable vehicle of evolutionary value. 
Bitcoin Eco is fast and environmentally sustainable._ 



**The evolved Bitcoin**

Bitcoin Eco
* Can run on 5 watts of power. On a device that cost $75 
* 1 confirmation in seconds to 1 minute.
* Is faster and just as secure as Bitcoin
* Functions built in to encourage stability. 
* $25 is solar hardware can reduce operating cost of Bitcoin Eco to $0 

The Value Transfer
21,000,000 million BTCECO was created on block 1 to facilitate the on-boarding of ALL Bitcoin that will ever exist from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Eco.
At the end of the on-boarding period all unclaimed BTCECO will be sent to a visible and public [Annihilation Addresses](https://btc-eco.com/index.php/annihilation-ledger/) Annihilation Addresses.

AnnihilationAddress – Is a Bitcoin or Bitcoin Eco Address that cannot be recovered or spent. Rendersthe value sent to these address removed from circulation and void.

Evolved Bitcoins- Are Bitcoins and their value that have went through the value transfer from BTC to BTCECO

On-boarding period- A period of time Bitcoin users are able to evolve their Bitcoin into Bitcoin Eco

NOTICE: ALL Annihilation Address used for both BTC an BTCECO will be publicly visible fortransparency purposes, public record and value accountability. 
Annihilation Address are unrecoverableby design. Once you send BTC or BTCECO to an  Annihilation Address is is lost FOREVER. 
Oncesent to an Annihilation address the balance should be considered removed from circulation / totalsupply. 

Here is the [Annihilation Ledger](https://btc-eco.com/index.php/annihilation-ledger/)  

Phase-1 p2p Value Transfer - launch the Bitcoin Eco Core networkBitcoin to Bitcoin Eco value transferring  by p2p. 

You will be provide a Bitcoin Annihilation Address for you to send your BTC to. At that time after 6 confirmations you will receive your BTCECO to whatever Bitcoin Eco address you provide. The Bitcoin Annihilation Address will be updated to the public Annihilation Ledger of value Transferred.  Your privacy is at utmost importance so your BTCECO address will NEVER be shared or corrilated to Bitcoin evolved value. After the transfer no records are kept to correlate the transfer on the BTCECO to BTCe. We must keep well documentation on  Bitcoin Annihilation Address because in essence Bitcoin Eco gets its value from evolved Bitcoins sent to Annihilation Address. The Public will want to watch these  Annihilation Address to make sure they stay out of circulation. After enough time and all value has been transferred this will be of little importants.
Phase-2 Automated Value TransferVoting among the Bitcoin Eco community will determin to pursue 

Phase -2. 
If its  determined.. Not a good idea for security purposes we will continue doing p2p value transfer. More time consuming but less vulnerabilities.
A system can be in place so you can transfer value from BTC to BTCECO through an automated secure platform if the community votes positively.
Deadline for value transfer? This will be voted on by the Bitcoin Eco community. Obviously each day or year we delay the on boarding deadline is one more day or year
we are supporting the wasteful usage of around 110 Terawatt Hours per year “More electricity used than some countries”.  

The on-boarding time will depend on the community vote. What happens if some Bitcoin users don’t transfer value to Bitcoin Eco
Two theories have emerged .
One is Bitcoin Eco will render a massive amount of Bitcoin “VOID” by sending them to Annihilation Address. 
This would cripple the total supply of Bitcoin to a point leaving it unsuitable as a value system. 
Another theory is Bitcoin Eco will remove a great deal of Bitcoin from circulation and making Bitcoin  more valuable.

Hopefully people will see the massive unnecessary waste of energy Bitcoin mining facilitates and be happy to transfer value to a more environmentally sustainable
Bitcoin Eco.Better Late than Never... Why accept an environmentally damaging consequence to a solvable problem? Bitcoin and its problems exists in ones and zeros. 
The solution will be found in the same place. Bitcoin will eventually destroy itself. In a world taking extreme measures to limit carbon footprints.

How could Bitcoin ever survive such an obvious infrastructure built on wasting energy? Bitcoin mining is a redundant  energy wasting version of Proof of Stake. 
The person or people who invest the most money on a Bitcoin mining operation will get the most Bitcoin rewards. The bigger the mining operation. 
The larger the Bitcoin reward. Bitcoin has inspired great loyalty. Convincing some to B Eco would be like like trying to convince a cat it wants to go swimming. 

They wont see Bitcoin as the sinking ship tell they are floating in the water. The Earth is our mother and our loyalty should be to do whats best for her. 
This GreenPaper is short because everyone knows Why we need something like BTCECO. Everyone knows what is wrong with Bitcoin. 
My only question is... will you help fix it? You don’t need to be a developer to help in this effort. 
Evolving your Bitcoin is as simple as sending it to an Annihilation Address and getting your BTCECO. Even if you have a very small amount of Bitcoin you can evolve
it today to Bitcoin Evo.<h6>
